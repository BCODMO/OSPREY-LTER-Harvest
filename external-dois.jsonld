      "description": "Viruses are integral to ecological and evolutionary processes, but we have a poor understanding of what drives variation in key traits across diverse viruses. For lytic viruses, burst size, latent period, and genome size are primary characteristics controlling host-virus dynamics. Here we synthesize data on these traits for 75 strains of phytoplankton viruses, which play an important role in global biogeochemistry. We find that primary traits of the host (genome size, growth rate) explain 40-50% of variation in burst size and latent period. Specifically, burst size and latent period both exhibit saturating relationships vs. the host:virus genome size ratio, with both traits increasing at low genome size ratios while showing no relationship at high size ratios. In addition, latent period declines as host growth rate increases. We analyze a model of latent period evolution to explore mechanisms that could cause these patterns. The model predicts that burst size may often be set by the host genomic resources available for viral construction, while latent period evolves to permit this maximal burst size, modulated by host metabolic rate. These results suggest that general mechanisms may underlie the evolution of diverse viruses. Future extensions of this work could help explain viral regulation of host populations, viral influence on community structure and diversity, and viral roles in biogeochemical cycles.",

      "description": "Developing robust professional networks can help shape the trajectories of early career scientists. Yet, historical inequities in STEM fields makes access to these networks highly variable across academic programs, and senior academics often have little time for mentoring. Here, we illustrate the success of a Virtual Lab Meeting Program (LaMP). In this program, we matched students (“Mentees”) with a more experienced researcher (“Mentors”) from a research group. The Mentees then attended the Mentors’ lab meetings during the academic year with two lab meetings specifically dedicated to the Mentee’s professional development. Survey results indicate that Mentees expanded their knowledge of the hidden curriculum as well as their professional network, while only requiring a few extra hours of their Mentor’s time over eight months. In addition, host labs benefitted from Mentees sharing new perspectives and knowledge in lab meetings. Diversity of the Mentees was significantly higher than the Mentors, suggesting that the program increased participation of traditionally underrepresented groups. Finally, we found that providing a stipend was very important to many mentees. We conclude that Virtual Lab Meeting Programs can be an inclusive and cost-effective way to foster trainee development and increase diversity within STEM fields with little additional time commitment.",
